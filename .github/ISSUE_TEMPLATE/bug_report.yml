        ### Build tested
        Please confirm that the problem can be reproduced on the **latest successful GitHub Actions build** (not Releases/Tags).

        **Quick how-to:**
        1) Open the repo's **Actions** tab and pick the most recent green run labeled **CI Build**.  
        2) On the run page, download the artifact (Summary → Artifacts), extract it, and put the `.jar` (no `-dev` / `-sources`) in your mods folder.  
        3) Reproduce the issue and paste the run URL below. If updating fixes it, please close the report.

        ### Mod conflict check
        If you're not sure whether this is a mod conflict, **remove all other mods** (keep only NTM:CE) and retry.  
        If it stops happening, add mods back until you find the offending mod.

        ### Platform notes
        If the issue only happens on a specific platform (singleplayer vs dedicated server vs hybrid server vs Cleanroom), please say so.  
        If this affects **dedicated server**, make sure the **server and client are on the same NTM:CE version/build**.
